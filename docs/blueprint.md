## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#A050A0) to reflect trust and modernity in sales.
- Background color: Light purple (#F0E5F0), nearly white, creates a calm and reliable base.
- Accent color: Blue (#5060A0), an analogous color, creates interest and provides contrast on the UI.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for titles and short information displays, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for longer text and descriptions.
- Use a consistent set of icons from a modern UI library. These should be monochromatic in the accent color.
- Keep a modern grid layout. Provide for differently-sized display formats.
- Use subtle transition animations for actions to show the user something has been registered. A short grow/shrink on click is a good way to accomplish this.
